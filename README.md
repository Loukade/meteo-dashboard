## Project Structure

```
/app               # Next.js app directory
/components        # React components (WeatherCard, CitySearch, ForecastModal, etc.)
/lib               # API fetch helpers (fetchWeather.ts)
```

## Usage

- On load, the app requests geolocation permission and fetches current weather + 5-day forecast for your location.  
- You can search for any city with the search bar and get the same detailed weather + forecast data.  
- Click on any weather card to open a modal with 3-hour interval detailed forecasts.  
- Supports light and dark modes (toggle available).

## Future Improvements

- Add graphical charts for temperature, wind, and precipitation using chart libraries like `recharts` or `chart.js`.  
- Store favorite cities locally for quick access.  
- Push notifications for weather alerts (rain, storms, etc.).  
- Multi-language support (i18n).  
- Accessibility enhancements and keyboard navigation.
